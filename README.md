🔧 Key Features & Implementation Details
(I will detail how you implemented specific things, for example:)

State Management: How the shopping cart state is handled (e.g., using a CartContext provider).

Product Data: Where the array of products is defined and how it's typed with TypeScript interfaces.

Snipcart Integration: How the Snipcart SDK is loaded and interacted with.

📝 Content Management
Adding a New Product
Add the product image to public/images/.

Open src/data/products.ts.

Add a new object to the products array, following the existing Product type interface. All fields will be type-checked.

typescript
{
  id: 'new-spicy-chips',
  name: 'Spicy Chili Chips',
  price: 6.49,
  description: 'A new delicious and spicy flavor!',
  imageUrl: '/images/product-spicy.jpg', // Path from public folder
  // ... other fields as defined in your type
}
The product will automatically appear on the page if it's mapped from this data array.
